# $${\color{green}Helping}$$ $${\color{green}Hands}$$: Supporting your mental well-being	

**Helping Hands** is a mental well-being app. As our motto states, "__**Supporting your mental well-being**__," our app provides tools that support the user’s well-being, such as a sleep calculator and daily mental health evaluation.

**<h2>Our features</h2>**

Helping Hands offers:

1. Sleep calculator and sleep facts page
2. Personal notepad
3. Mental Health Evaluation

**<h2> The app’s development phase </h2>**

The development of Helping Hands started in early 2024. We started with simple brainstorming and then created designs using Canva. We first made a few prototypes with Python. Later, we developed an early version of Helping Hands using MiT App Inventor for the mental health segment of the Zayed Sustainability Prize. 

The app's development resumed in January of this year, and this month, we released the first full version of Helping Hands, version 1.0.0.

**<h2>Availability of the app</h2>**

Helping Hands is currently only available as an APK file on Android; however, we plan to expand it to other platforms. You may find the APK file in this repository.
